# XpenseTracker
App to keep track of expenses. WebSite: http://50.116.12.156

# To Do
- Features
- [ ] Visualization of expense trends (using dimple or d3)
- [ ] Site map (will be a guide for first time users)


- UI
- [ ] Improve error messages (make them more meaningful and appropriate)
- [ ] Improve form interaction (submit on enter; improve keyboard use)


- Code enhancements
- [ ] CSS refactor (better reusability; assigning classes; use Sass)
- [ ] Further componentize front end JS (nav bar code should ideally be reused)
- [ ] Font sizing based on viewport.

- Future Considerations
- [ ] about the website page (to record my learning / experiments)
- [ ] mobile website?? (or make the existing one mobile compatible)
